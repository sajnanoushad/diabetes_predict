Deep Learning - Predicting Diabetes Progression using Artificial Neural Networks

The objective is to create a model that predicts how diabetes progresses using the given independent variables. This model will help healthcare professionals see how different factors affect diabetes progression, which can help them create better treatment plans and preventive strategies. The goal is to provide clear insights into how diabetes develops in patients over time.

Objective

This model will help healthcare professionals understand how different factors influence the progression of diabetes and potentially aid in designing better treatment plans and preventive measures. The model will provide insights into the dynamics of diabetes progression in patients.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library. It consists of 442 samples with 10 normalized features such as age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure of diabetes progression one year after baseline
